# Slot_Game
The slot consists of 3 lines and 4 symbols 'A', 'B' ,'C' and 'D' on which the user places his bet. User deposits money in his account and then bet some amount(money) on the line/lines of the 3.If he wins the amount gets deposit to his account else gets deducted.

The major problem I faced during the development of this project was the score.
sometimes even when user wins the money was not added in his account.This problem was cut short after i returned the score to every calling function.
